## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **3-D realism mission (motion core overhaul).** The movement figure's motion
  is now biomechanically grounded and test-verified end to end: the pelvis
  travels with the authored motion and the feet stay planted (root travel +
  grounding with a unit-tested two-bone IK), joint rotations clamp to
  AAOS-cited human ranges, an optional per-bone axial twist enables pronation/
  rotation, per-phase easing plus a bounded, literature-anchored breath and
  postural-sway overlay make holds read alive, and the trunk is a segmented
  lumbar/thoracic/cervical chain with clavicles and toes (rigid by default —
  proven equivalent to the old skeleton to 0.000000000 units — with opt-in,
  chest-orientation-preserving curvature). "Realistic" is enforceable: a
  biomechanical-plausibility validator (Dempster/Winter center-of-mass over the
  base of support; it surfaced three real content defects, tracked as a
  shrink-only waiver ratchet) and a visual-regression harness (312 deterministic
  draw-command signatures + an SVG gallery with human-approved baselines) run in
  CI. Recorded activity can drive the figure (cadence→tempo/gait, HR→breathing/
  effort, hard-capped fatigue droop) behind an off-by-default hookup, a vendored-
  asset license & size manifest gate protects every future binary, and a
  self-mocap authoring scaffold (MoveNet COCO-17 mapping, synthetic-fixture
  tested; weights never committed) lets contributors draft new movements from
  webcam video. Remaining from the mission: the WebGL avatar scaffold, which
  needs vendored three.js (connected session).
- **3-D movement figure (beta).** A new engine-agnostic 3-D motion core
  (`web/js/pose3d.js`): a humanoid skeleton, quaternion bone-rotation math,
  forward kinematics, pose interpolation, and a 2-D→3-D IK adapter that derives
  3-D bone rotations from the existing 2-D keyframes — so all 56 exercises gain a
  3-D pose with no re-authoring (hand-authored `poses3d` tracks can override). A
  dependency-free canvas renderer (`web/js/formModel3d.js`) draws an orbitable,
  depth-shaded capsule figure with no WebGL; a **2-D / 3-D (beta)** toggle sits in
  the Home tab, with the SVG engine staying the default and reduced-motion
  fallback. A heavier three.js skinned-avatar renderer is planned on the same pose
  data (see `docs/form-model-3d/architecture.md`); asset-licensing rules are in
  CONTRIBUTING. Math is unit-tested (`tests/js/pose3d.test.js`).
- **GUI session builder (Home + Tai Chi).** A pure, unit-tested selection function
  (`web/js/sessionBuilder.js`) turns the libraries + your inputs (length, sets/
  reps, equipment, tier, focus) into a balanced, time-budgeted session: Home
  sessions cover lower body, upper body and core (plus balance for fragile
  starters), warm up first and cool down last, never repeat an exercise or two
  regions in a row, gate isometrics behind PAR-Q+ clearance, and swap in a
  dumbbell/kettlebell variant for "Free weights"; Tai Chi flows cover balance/
  mobility/lower-limb/breathing and bookend on the breath. A session-mode player
  (`web/js/sessionPlayer.js`) chains the selection through the form-model engine
  with rest screens, a progress counter and a completion summary, fully offline
  and keyboard-operable. Coach easy/rest days can pull a body-part-varied strength
  session from the same builder. `region`/`equipment`/`weighted_variant` are
  derived from `pattern` (the incoming metadata lacks them).
- **Coach: objective → personalized plan → calendar.** A new objective form in
  the Coach tab (and `POST /api/coach/plan`, `garminimax plan …`) turns a goal
  (5K/10K/half/marathon/general, dates or weeks, optional goal time, days, level)
  into a dated base→build→peak→taper→race plan with step-back weeks, a tune-up
  effort and rest days. Each session carries a pace/heart-rate/effort target as a
  RANGE with a confidence and the evidence grade behind it (VDOT/Riegel/Karvonen/
  RPE), and the whole plan exports as an `.ics` calendar (`GET /api/coach/plan.ics`,
  `--ics PATH`). Pure/stdlib core (`core/plan_builder.py`, `core/ics.py`), reusing
  the adaptive controller for the periodized skeleton. Honest by construction: the
  10% rule is never asserted as injury-protective, ACWR is a signal only, ranges
  widen for low mileage, and it is framed as training information, not medical
  advice.
- **Home exercise library (35) + Tai Chi movement library (21).** The Sports at
  Home form-model now ships the full data-driven library — including the complete
  push-up progression (wall → counter → chair → knee → floor) — with each
  exercise carrying its library metadata (pattern, tier, default/regression/
  progression object, primary benefit, evidence refs, notes), surfaced beside the
  player with citations. The Tai Chi tab ships 21 movement/breathing pacers
  normalized from the authoring schema into the shared engine's canonical schema
  (`scripts/normalize_incoming.py`, unit-tested), with level/focus/refs/notes
  wired in. Still framed honestly as a simplified pacer, not instructed form. The
  content packs are guarded by extended integrity tests (phase↔pose, citation
  resolution, valid tiers/patterns/levels, and that every object id exists in the
  engine's glyph registry).
- **Form-model engine: pseudo-3-D, corrected feet, free weights.** The shared SVG
  movement engine now runs every joint through a unit-tested yaw projection
  (`web/js/formGeom.js`), so poses can carry optional depth (`z`); a gentle
  auto-turn toggle and a manual turn slider give a subtle 3-D feel (persisted).
  Side-view feet gain a synthesized heel so the foot reads as a wedge and the toe
  leads the facing direction, plus a mirror/face control to flip left/right. New
  object glyphs: `counter` and `step` (rooms) and `dumbbell`/`kettlebell`
  (free weights that track the hands). All existing preferences, 60 fps
  attribute-only updates, and the reduced-motion static fallback are preserved.
  The projection/foot/shading math is verified under Node via a new pytest gate
  (`tests/test_js_units.py`, `tests/js/`).
- **FIT Salvage** — recover corrupt/truncated `.FIT` files locally: walks the
  record stream to the last complete record, repairs the header/CRC and
  re-parses (deriving the summary from records when the session trailer was
  lost). Available as `garminimax salvage`, `POST /api/salvage`, and a "Recover
  a corrupt file" panel on Import/Sync. The original is never modified.
- **Sports at Home** — guided, evidence-based home training with household
  objects: a bundled offline content pack + curation report, a PAR-Q+-style
  readiness screen (client-only) that gates isometric work, a data-driven SVG
  form-model animation engine (tempo pacer, front/side views, reduced-motion
  fallback) and a 30-second sit-to-stand capacity check.
- **Year in Sport recap** — a private, local annual/all-time recap with a
  self-contained, shareable HTML export.
- **Personal privacy audit** — a defensive, local self-audit of what your tracks
  reveal (likely home, routine), recommending a privacy radius.
- **Personal segments** — capture a route from an activity and race yourself over
  your history (private leaderboard + trend).
- **Liberate Your History** — import a Garmin/Strava account export (nested zips +
  gzip) via an `export` source mode, the Import/Sync page and a
  `garminimax import-export` CLI command.
- **File/folder picker** — a "Browse…" button (backed by a read-only
  `GET /api/fs/list`) on the export-import and Settings source fields, so paths
  never have to be typed; plus an editable activity-source section in Settings.
- `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue/PR templates, and
  a Dependabot config for community readiness.
- CI now runs `ruff` (lint), `bandit` (security, medium+), and `pip-audit`
  (dependency vulnerabilities) alongside the test suite.
- `dev` optional-dependency group (`ruff`, `bandit`, `pip-audit`) and `[tool.ruff]`
  / `[tool.bandit]` configuration in `pyproject.toml`.

### Changed
- GPX/TCX imports now parse XML with `defusedxml` to harden against
  entity-expansion / external-entity attacks in untrusted activity files.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial development version: local-first acquisition (mass storage / MTP / path
  / folder / file / zip), lossless raw `.FIT` storage, SQLite store, FastAPI
  loopback server, vanilla-JS GUI, CLI, multi-format import (FIT/TCX/GPX),
  content-hash dedupe, anonymized export (CSV/JSON/GPX/TCX/raw + NDJSON archive),
  training zones, insights, and analytics.

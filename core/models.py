"""Domain models for Garminimax.

These are plain dataclasses with no dependency on the web or CLI layers, so the
core library can be used on its own. Field comments record the physical units of
each value (FIT stores SI-ish units; we preserve them rather than reducing to a
minimal subset). Any additional FIT fields not promoted to a dedicated attribute
are retained in the ``extra`` mapping as ``{name: {"value": ..., "units": ...}}``
so nothing is lost.

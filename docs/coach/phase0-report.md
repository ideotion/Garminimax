# Evidence-Based Training-Program Knowledge Base — Garminimax Coaching Assistant

Phase 0 deliverable: verified citation backbone, schemas, one fully worked reference program, deterministic personalization ruleset, sourced normative tables, and a build roadmap for the remaining goal × sport matrix.

Author context: prepared for the Garminimax project (local-first, offline Garmin analytics). All content is designed to ship as static bundled data plus deterministic rules — no runtime machine learning, no network calls at advice time.

> Note: this Markdown is the human-readable synthesis / audit trail. The companion
> machine-readable artefacts (bibliography.json, schema.json, normative_data.json,
> personalization_ruleset.json, program_run_marathon_intermediate_16wk.json) are the
> authoritative deliverables and are ingested separately. The structured subset that
> the app currently renders lives in `web/content/coach/overview.json`.

## 1. Scope and why this is staged

The source specification sets one non-negotiable rule: no fabricated citations. Every physiological claim must trace to a real source with a resolvable DOI or URL, and every recommendation must carry an evidence grade. Honouring that rule means the work cannot be a single-pass dump of one hundred plus program templates, because a credible matrix of that size cannot be citation-checked in one sitting without inventing references.

This Phase 0 therefore delivers the load-bearing foundation that everything else snaps onto: a verified bibliography (each entry flagged web-verified or pending-DOI-confirmation), a JSON Schema constraining every template/normative row/rule to carry sources and grades, one complete schema-valid reference program (intermediate marathon, 16 weeks), a deterministic personalization ruleset keyed to the exact app metric field names, sourced normative tables, and a coverage tracker / per-sport build order.

The remaining matrix cells (other running distances, cycling disciplines, cross-sport goals, muscle-gain blocks) are enumerated in the roadmap and generated sport-block by sport-block against this same verified backbone.

## 2. Method and evidence grading

Sources were selected to cover the physiological pillars the app must reason about: intensity distribution, threshold and heart-rate modelling, periodization and tapering, concurrent strength training, resistance-training dose, protein and fuelling, workload-injury modelling, and energy availability. Primary preference: meta-analyses, position stands, large cohort studies.

Evidence grades: **Strong** (consistent meta-analytic/multi-RCT), **Moderate** (supported, with heterogeneity / smaller samples / population-specific), **Limited** (sparse, indirect, contested), **Emerging** (early/debated), **Practice** (a coaching/textbook convention in standard use, not anchored to one high-quality trial — exists so conventional zone boundaries and heuristics can be included without a fabricated citation).

The verification convention (honesty by construction): each bibliography entry carries `web_verified_2026-06` (DOI/identifier confirmed by search this build) or `domain_knowledge_UNVERIFIED` (a real, well-known source whose exact DOI/edition the implementer should confirm before shipping — flagged, not hidden).

---

## 3. Worked reference program: intermediate marathon, 16 weeks

`program_run_marathon_intermediate_16wk.json` encodes a pyramidal intensity distribution of roughly 80% easy / 15% threshold / 5% hard, matching elite and sub-elite distance runners [ref_seiler2010] [ref_haugen2022]. Structure: four mesocycles — Base (5 wk), Build (4), Peak (4), Taper (3) — on a 3:1 loading pattern with a deload every fourth week.

- **Periodization & weekly load.** Volume rises from an entry level anchored to recent training, progressing at a capped rate with scheduled deloads, peaking before the taper (representative athlete peaks near 70 km/week with a longest run of 34 km in the peak block). *(Figure pending asset.)*
- **Intensity distribution.** The plan keeps the majority of running easy, with a controlled threshold fraction and a small hard fraction that grows modestly in the peak block; the app stores pyramidal, polarized and threshold models so a plan can shift emphasis by block [ref_seiler2010] [ref_rosenblat2019]. *(Figure pending asset.)*
- **Concurrent strength.** Two short strength sessions/week through Base and Build because heavy and explosive resistance training improves running economy and maximal strength without harming distance performance [ref_ronnestad2014] [ref_beattie2014] [ref_berryman2018]. Interference managed: separated from quality runs by ≥6 h where possible, kept heavy and low-rep rather than fatiguing, and tapered out before the race.
- **Taper.** Final two weeks cut volume ~50% while maintaining intensity and frequency, following the meta-analytic optimum [ref_bosquet2007].
- **Entry gate.** Expects a recent average of ≥35 km/week or CTL ≥40; a true beginner is routed to a base-building plan instead.

Each microcycle session in the JSON carries its own citation list and personalization links binding its targets to the athlete's metrics.

## 4. Deterministic personalization

`personalization_ruleset.json` is twelve closed-form rules. None requires a model at runtime; each takes named app metrics in and returns concrete targets out, with a fallback when an input is missing. The field names consumed are the app's own: `max_hr, resting_hr, ftp_w, weight_kg, height_cm, sex, age, vo2max_vdot, normalized_power, intensity_factor, variability_index, tss, efficiency_factor, aerobic_decoupling, grade_adjusted_pace, hr_zone_time, power_zone_time, ctl, atl, tsb, weekly_volume_km, weekly_elevation_m, mean_max_power_curve, mean_max_pace_curve`.

Worked example (hypothetical athlete) — inputs: male, age 38, resting_hr 52, max_hr not measured, vo2max_vdot 50, weight_kg 72, weekly_volume_km ~45, ctl 55, atl 60, tsb −5:

1. **Estimate HRmax** (only because missing). Tanaka: 208 − 0.7 × 38 ≈ 181 bpm [ref_tanaka2001]; a measured value overrides; the large standard error is flagged so zones are treated as approximate [ref_shookster2020].
2. **HR zones via Karvonen** (HRR = 181 − 52 = 129) [ref_karvonen1957]: Z1 117–129, Z2 129–142, Z3 142–155, Z4 155–168, Z5 168–181 bpm.
3. **Running paces from VDOT 50** via the velocity–oxygen-cost relationship (no copyrighted table reproduced): easy ~5:15–5:50/km, marathon ~4:40/km, threshold ~4:20/km, interval ~4:00/km — formula outputs that update as `vo2max_vdot` changes.
4. **Starting volume & progression**: 45 km/week start; weekly increases capped ~8–10% with a deload every 4th week.
5. **Entry gate**: 45 km/week + ctl 55 clears the marathon gate (≥35 km/week or ctl ≥40).
6. **Readiness & taper**: tsb −5 is neutral/maintenance; the two-week taper cuts volume ~50% while holding intensity [ref_bosquet2007].
7. **Durability autoregulation**: on long runs, if `aerobic_decoupling` exceeds ~5% the session is held rather than extended.

The entire decision path is inspectable, with every numeric threshold tied to a source or labelled Practice.

## 5. Normative reference data

`normative_data.json` holds fifteen sourced tables, every row carrying `source_ref` and `evidence_grade`:

- HRmax prediction equations (Fox, Tanaka, Gulati) with accuracy review and SE caveats [ref_tanaka2001] [ref_gulati2010] [ref_shookster2020].
- HR zone models, %HRmax and Karvonen HRR [ref_karvonen1957] [ref_seiler2010].
- Cycling power zones, 7-zone %FTP convention [ref_cogganallen].
- TSB interpretation bands for readiness and taper timing [ref_cogganallen] [ref_banister1991].
- Intensity-distribution models — pyramidal, polarized, threshold [ref_seiler2010] [ref_haugen2022] [ref_rosenblat2019].
- Protein intake by goal and per dose [ref_morton2018] [ref_jager2017].
- Resistance-training volume and frequency landmarks [ref_schoenfeld2017vol] [ref_schoenfeld2016freq].
- %1RM to repetition relationship [ref_nsca_haff2016].
- Strength-training effects in endurance athletes [ref_ronnestad2014] [ref_beattie2014] [ref_berryman2018].
- Taper parameters [ref_bosquet2007].
- Race-time prediction (Riegel) with an ultra caveat [ref_riegel1981].
- Carbohydrate intake during prolonged exercise [ref_jeukendrup2014].
- Energy-availability thresholds for RED-S [ref_mountjoy2018].

## 7. Safety, ethics, and contested evidence

- **Medical disclaimer.** Educational, not medical advice. Plans assume an apparently healthy adult cleared for exercise; the app surfaces a recommendation to consult a professional, and red-flag symptoms (chest pain, syncope, unusual breathlessness) route the user out of training guidance.
- **RED-S and energy availability.** Treated as a first-class safety constraint; the low-availability threshold near 30 kcal/kg fat-free mass/day triggers education and referral rather than aggressive prescription [ref_mountjoy2018]. Weight-loss content is capped at a sustainable rate and paired with elevated protein to protect lean mass [ref_donnelly2009] [ref_jager2017].
- **Anti-doping.** Content stays within nutrition, training and recovery; defer to current WADA guidance; no recommendation touching prohibited methods/substances.
- **The ACWR debate, presented both ways.** The acute-to-chronic workload ratio was proposed with a lower-risk sweet spot ~0.8–1.3 [ref_gabbett2016]; that model has since been substantively criticized for mathematical coupling, collider bias, and other artefacts [ref_impellizzeri2020]. The app treats a large acute spike relative to recent training as a reasonable prompt for caution, but does not present any ACWR number as a validated injury predictor. The template progression caps are justified by general progressive-overload prudence, not by ACWR.

## 8. Build roadmap for subsequent turns

One block per turn, each producing schema-valid templates plus any new sourced normative rows, all against this bibliography:

1. Remaining running distances — 5k, 10k, half — beginner/intermediate/advanced, two durations each.
2. Trail and ultra — adds `weekly_elevation_m` and `grade_adjusted_pace` emphasis, Riegel ultra caveat, fuelling tables.
3. Cycling disciplines — criterium, 40 km TT, gran fondo, ultra, MTB/gravel — keyed to `ftp_w`, power zones, `normalized_power`, `intensity_factor`, `variability_index`.
4. Cross-sport goals — get strong, lose weight, stay fit.
5. Muscle gain — general hypertrophy + sport-specific concurrent variants.
6. Glossary, final coverage-checklist closure, and confirmation of the DOIs flagged pending.
